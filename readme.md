  ## Description
  In this project, I used node, express, and mysql to make a backend database for a business and in it I was able to add functionality to allow the user to create, read, update, and delete from the different models.

  ## Installation
  First you need Insomnia and MySql workbench signed up and installed. Then just run npm install from the package.json file and you will be good to go.

  ## Usage
  First, install the necessary dependencies. Then, create a .env file with your "DB_NAME" "DB_USER", and "DB_PW". From there you should be able to run "mysql -u root -p" from the terminal and input your mysql password, then type "source ./db/schema.sql". One the text stops you can type "quit". From there, run "npm run seed" followed by "npm run start" once it's done seeding. Finally, open up Insomnia and explore the different routes available in the api folder.
